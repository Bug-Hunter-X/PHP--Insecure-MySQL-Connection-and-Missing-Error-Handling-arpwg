This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily avoidable bug in PHP involving insecure database interactions and missing error handling.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code using the deprecated `mysql_*` functions. The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates a corrected version using the more secure and modern `mysqli_*` functions with improved error handling. This example highlights the importance of secure coding practices and proper resource management in PHP.
